I am Senior Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Creative Technologies at the [University of the West of England Bristol](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/about/faculties-and-departments/environment-and-technology/computer-science-creative-technologies) where I research on and teach about topics related to multiagent systems, distributed artificial intelligence and their applications. I am recipient of the *UWE's Vice Chancellor Early Career Research Award 2022*. 

Before joining UWE I was Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Institute for Manufacturing (IfM) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/), working mainly on the design of agent-based control systems.

<!-- working with [Prof. Ajith Parlikad](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/aknp2/) and [Prof. Duncan McFarlane](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/dm114/). -->
</p>

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/informatics), I studied autonomy and self-adaptation in systems of smart objects and how to realise these behaviours through middleware architectures. 

<!-- as part of the team of [Prof. Stephan Reiff-Marganiec](https://www.derby.ac.uk/staff/reiff-marganiec-stephan) -->
